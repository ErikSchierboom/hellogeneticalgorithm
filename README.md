# Hello Genetic Algorithm
This project contains an implementation of a [generic algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) that allows text to be evolved from random strings using a very simple genetic algorithm. The implementation is done in F#, which is a functional language that is very well suited for this type of problems.

To make this project slightly more interesting, we have made the functionality available from a console application (not so hard) and from an ASP.NET MVC application. We have tried to use F# wherever we can use in the ASP.NET MVC application.
